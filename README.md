Munch Munch ðŸ’€ 

Feed the dog by eating the hand out of the grave. But be careful, if the crow or the child detect you, the game is over.

How to play :
 - Space :  eat
 - Enter : reset game once you get caught

This game was made within 3 hours, during the Trijam #241 with the theme "Sometimes accident happens !" (sadly, we didn't have time to submit and maybe this is the accident). It was our first game together !
